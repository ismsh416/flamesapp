# Flamesapp

FlamesApp is a fun game where you can enter your name and your partner's name to reveal your relationship status based on the FLAMES acronym.

## What Each FLAMES Letter Means:
- **F - Friends**: The ultimate buddy system! You're destined to share countless laughs and adventures together.
- **L - Lovers**: A match made in heaven! Your hearts are in sync and the sparks will always fly.
- **A - Affectionate**: You're warm and fuzzy for each other. A cozy connection that's all about hugs and smiles.
- **M - Marriage**: Bells are ringing! A lifelong journey of love and partnership awaits you.
- **E - Enemies**: Oh no! You might clash heads more often than not. But every story needs its drama, right?
- **S - Siblings**: Like family from another lifetime. You share a bond that’s both unique and unbreakable.

## How to Play

2. Enter your partner's name in the second input field.
